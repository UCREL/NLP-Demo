# C7 to JSON

In this directory we have the following:

1. [./C7_tag_set.txt](./C7_tag_set.txt) - which contains a C7 tag and associated label on each new line. Some of the labels contain examples in parentheses. This text file was generated by copying and pasting the data from the following web page [http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws7tags.html](http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws7tags.html)
2. [./C7_to_json.py](./C7_to_json.py) - a Python script that takes as it's first and second argument files 1 and 3 in this list respectively. Note that the 1st argument has to exist and the second argument is generated by this Python script.
3. [./C7_tag_label.json](./C7_tag_label.json) -- A JSON formatted file whereby all the keys and values are POS tags and their respective labels taken from [./C7_tag_set.txt](./C7_tag_set.txt) file, **BUT** none of the labels contain any examples that were written in parentheses.

The JSON file when loaded into python allows you to lookup the label associated with a C7 POS tag e.g.:

``` python
from pathlib import Path
import json

c7_json_file_path = Path('C7_tag_label.json')
tag_to_label = {}
with c7_json_file_path.open('r') as _fp:
    tag_to_label = json.load(_fp)

assert tag_to_label['DD2'] == 'plural determiner'
```
