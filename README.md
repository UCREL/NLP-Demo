# NLP-Demo

The steps to go from a directory full of theses to all of the data to run the NLP-Demo website:

1. The NLP-Demo expects all of the theses to be stored in the thesis directory at `./thesis_directory`
2. The text version of these theses will be stored in `./export_directory`, to create the text versions see the [./pdfs_to_text/README.md file](./pdfs_to_text).
3. To create the token and USAS tag statistics that will be used by the word cloud visualisation see the [./word_cloud_statistics/README.md file](./word_cloud_statistics). These token and USAS tag statistics will be stored at `thesis_token_statistics.json` and `thesis_usas_tag_statistics.json` respectively by default.
